    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a computer engineering graduate with 10 years of work experience. I consider myself a person who is always
      willing to learn new technologies, new market trends, and operating models, which generate new challenges.
      I currently work as a DevOps Engineer, which has allowed me to work with several clients, helping them adopt the
      DevOps culture, use tools that contribute to Continuous Integration/Delivery, implement new market trends, and
      create cloud infrastructure. Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering, in the Department of Mechanical Control
      Engineering and Automation, from the Polytechnic School of the University of SÃ£o Paulo.

education:

    info:
      - degree: M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering Related Technologies
        university: University of Sao Paulo, Brazil
        time: 2018 - 2021
        details: |
          My work aimed to analyze and identify different characteristics of the acoustic signal emitted by a gas bubble
          formed underwater. To do so, it was necessary to combine some mathematical models that allow a better
          understanding of this physical phenomenon, with digital signal and image processing, which allowed achieving
          the desired results. As a contribution, this work helped to construct a passive acoustic monitoring system to
          detect CO2 leaks in tanks found on the seabed.
