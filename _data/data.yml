    summary: |
      I am a computer engineering graduate with 10 years of work experience. I consider myself a person who is always
      willing to learn new technologies, new market trends, and operating models, which generate new challenges.
      I currently work as a DevOps Engineer, which has allowed me to work with several clients, helping them adopt the
      DevOps culture, use tools that contribute to Continuous Integration/Delivery, implement new market trends, and

education:

    info:
      - degree: M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering Related Technologies
        university: University of Sao Paulo, Brazil
        time: 2018 - 2021
        details: |
          My work aimed to analyze and identify different characteristics of the acoustic signal emitted by a gas bubble
          formed underwater. To do so, it was necessary to combine some mathematical models that allow a better
          understanding of this physical phenomenon, with digital signal and image processing, which allowed achieving
          the desired results. As a contribution, this work helped to construct a passive acoustic monitoring system to
          detect CO2 leaks in tanks found on the seabed.
